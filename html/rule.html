            <h2>
                "Last Free Cell Rule"
            </h2>
            <p>
                "Last free cell" is the basic Sudoku solving technique. It's pretty simple and based on the fact that
                each 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row on Sudoku grid should contain numbers from 1 to 9 and
                each number can be used only once within 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, if we see that there is only one free cell left in the 3×3 block, vertical column or
                horizontal row, then we have to define which number from 1 to 9 is missing and enter it in this empty
                cell.
                <br><br>
                You may see the example below:
            </p>
            <div class="img">
                <img src="../img/lastcell.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Last remaining cell -->
        <div class="last-remaining-cell">
            <h2>
                "Last Remaining Cell Rule"
            </h2>
            <p>
                "Last remaining cell" is another basic Sudoku strategy. It's based on the fact that numbers should not
                be repeated within 3×3 block, vertical column and horizontal row.
                <br><br>
                Let's take a look at an example with the 3x3 block. There always must be number 8 - in each block,
                column and row. There's already 8 in the column and in the row. As we already know, we can't repeat
                numbers. So we can't place 8 there again. It means that there's only one cell remaining inside the block
                and we should put number 8 into it.

            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Other rule -->
        <div class="other-rule">
            <h2>
                "What are the basic rules of Sudoku?"
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are many other rules that can be used to solve Sudoku puzzles. Some of them are:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sudoku grid consists of 9x9 spaces.</li>
                <li>You can use only numbers from 1 to 9.</li>
                <li>Each 3×3 block can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.</li>
                <li>Each vertical column can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.</li>
                <li>Each horizontal row can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.</li>
                <li>Each number in the 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row can be used only once.</li>
                <li>The game is over when the whole Sudoku grid is correctly filled with numbers.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            There are already many numbers filled in on the grid in the simple Sudoku puzzles. Therefore it’s not so
            difficult to cope with the solution if you are familiar with the basic rules. However, in order to solve
            difficult levels and deal with them quickly, you need to use some tricks and learn advanced Sudoku
            techniques.
